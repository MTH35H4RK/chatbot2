                  "question": "What role do Gravitational Resonance Rings play on Myriabel?",
                  "answer": "Gravitational Resonance Rings on Myriabel are enormous ring-shaped geological formations that encircle the planet. They are the result of a complex interaction between the planet's gravitational field and its moon system. These rings generate a stable, protective field that shields Myriabel from harmful cosmic radiation, enabling the thriving of surface and subterranean ecosystems."
